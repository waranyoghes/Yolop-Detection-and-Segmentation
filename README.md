# Yolop-Detection-and-Segmentation
###### This repo contains the code for the detection and segmentation using a single network.
##### Network Details
###### The network developed in this repo is a model based on the YOLOP paper. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11250.pdf).  
###### Please note that this is not the exact replica of the model. It is developed based on my understanding of the paper.

###### Backbone - CSPDarknet53 
###### Neck - Feature pyramid Module(https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144) and SPP (https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4729v4). 
###### Detection Block - Path aggregation network (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01534).
