# Yolop-Detection-and-Segmentation
###### This repo contains the code for the detection and segmentation using a single network.
##### Network Details
###### The network developed in this repo is a model based on the YOLOP paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11250.pdf).
###### Netwok structure:- 1] Backbone-CSPDarknet53 
3] Neck-Feature pyramid Module(https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144) and SPP (https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4729v4). 
4] Detection Block - Path aggregation network (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01534). 
5] Segemetation Block- U-net.
